**Conclusions**
---
- Propoer data cleaning were essential to ensuring our models could learn effectively.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization helped us identify key trends and correlations that guided our model-building process.
- Decision Tree Classifiers provided clear, interpretable models and gave us insight into how different features contributed to predictions.
- Random Forest classifiers outperformed basic decision trees in terms of accuracy and generalization, showing the power of ensemble methods.
- GridSearchCV helped us fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance, demonstrating the value of systematic tuning.
- Our final models achieved good predictive performance, confirming that it's feasible to classify the data accurately using machine learning techniques.
